Cooking Helper

Overview

This is a project I built for my Software Engineering I class. We were given several project ideas to choose from, and I decided to create a cooking helper application.

The main goal of this project was to build something that helps with meal planning and basic inventory management, while also giving me experience working on a larger C++ program.

What the Project Does

Cooking Helper lets you:
	•	Create and store recipes
	•	Add ingredients and quantities
	•	View and update recipes later
	•	Remove recipes when they are no longer needed

Everything runs in the terminal with simple menus so it is easy to navigate. Everything is stored locally on your system, you can have multiple users running on the same program under different usernames.

Required Files

Almost everything in this project is generated by the program.
The only file that needs to be included is:

AppRecipes.txt

This file holds the default “app recipes” that load when the program starts.
It stores recipe names, instructions, and ingredient information in a simple text format:

The program reads this file so users always have a starting set of recipes available.

What I Focused On

While building this project, I focused on:
	•	Structuring the program so it was easier to follow
	•	Using classes and objects
	•	Handling user input safely
	•	Planning features before writing the code

This helped me practice thinking more like a software developer instead of just writing small standalone programs.

How to Run

Simply download the sourcecode from this repository and compile with at least C++23.
